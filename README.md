we use Bluetooth technology to control a robotic vehicle via an Android device. Commands are sent from the Android mobile to make the vehicle move. The Arduino UNO controls the vehicle, converting signals into movements. Bluetooth technology enables effective communication and remote interchangeability with various Android devices
A remote controlled vehicle is any machine controlled by means that is physically not connected with origin external to the machine. There are many types in it, based on the controls â€“ radio control device, Wi-Fi controlled and even Bluetooth controlled. These devices are always controlled by umans and take no action autonomously. The main target in such vehicles would be to safely reach a designated point, the area and reach back to the point of origin
